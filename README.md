Multi Resolution Grid {#mainpage}
=====================

This software project consists of numerical modules meant to compiled into libs:

- monores_grid_t (folder monores) to provide a regular grid
- multires_grid_t (folder multires) to provide a multi resolution grid to perform multi resolution analysis
- an abstract class grid_t to define a common interface for both resolution modules
- a theory helper theory_t to setup initial conditions and allow error analysis

Furthermore there are some modules which are meant to actually run the code:

- **rawRunner** compiles against *monores* or *multires* and performs computation.
  Output is written to files.
- **guiRunner** compiles against both resolution modules and provides a live plot to see
  what's actually going on.
- **compaRunner** compiles against both resolution modules and performs numerical error
  analysis to compare the error propagation.

Additionally there are some global header files:

- settings.h holds some default configuration data
- functions.h holds different functions to initialize the computation
- point.hpp defines the attributes of one grid point

## Compiling

This project uses the tools provided by the [Qt project](http://qt-project.org/)
for developing and building the source, namely the [Qt Creator](http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:Tools::QtCreator)
and [QMake](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qmake-manual.html).

Although this project takes advantage of Qt tools, Qt itself is only a dependency for
the **guiRunner** module.

The project has been tested with both CLang and GCC compilers. The Makefiles are
generated by executing `qmake ../path/to/source` in the build directory.

- gcc (SUSE Linux) 4.8.1 20130909 [gcc-4_8-branch revision 202388]
- clang version 3.3 (branches/release_33 183898)
- clang version 3.4 (https://github.com/clang-omp/clang [47c90595adcc31d595aabd4db09894b23cbaafd2](https://github.com/clang-omp/clang/tree/47c90595adcc31d595aabd4db09894b23cbaafd2)) openmp-enabled
- QMake version 2.01a

## Configuration

The configuration is done by editing the header files settings.h and functions.h,
and as well by providing some defines to the C precompiler.

- define `REGULAR` to make rawRunner build against the regular grid instead of the multi resolution grid
- define `_OMP` is set automatically by openmp if compilation is done with GCC compiler
- define `LIMITER` can be set to enable the limiter for derivatives in the flow calculation

## Generation of Documentation

The documentation is generated from the source using [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).
Navigate to the repository root directory and run: `doxygen doc/Doxyfile`
