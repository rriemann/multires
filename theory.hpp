   \brief The theory_t class is a helper class to calculate the theoretical solution at given points in time

   This class is initialized with a maximum level to determine the smallest node size.
   Afterwards the theoretical result of the advection equation at given time points
   can be calculated using the at() functions.

   This class is used to initialize the field at time `t = 0` and furthermore to
   facilitate the error analysis.
