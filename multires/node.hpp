       \brief The position_t enum

       Positions in the cell are ordered like this:

           NW(2) | NE(3)
           -------------
           SW(0) | SE(1)

       Orientations with respect to one cell are ordered like this:

               N(3)
                |
           W(0) - E(1)
                |
               S(2)

       There is a difference between positions and orientations. Position is
       what gives you the place in one cell. Orientation is the perspective
       if you want to query for neighbouring cells.
